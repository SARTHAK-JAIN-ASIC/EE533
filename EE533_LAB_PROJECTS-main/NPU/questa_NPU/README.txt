This contains bfloat16 adder, bfloat16 multiplier, dotproduct calculation for hidden layer, ReLu, and Output Layer MAC. It also contains testbenches for the adder, the multiplier, and the NPU_top.

The NPU_top combines all the layers together.

The software folder contains the trained ANN written in python, along with some other python scripts that were used to debug and troubleshoot the simulations.
